# Triangular_number_Series :small_red_triangle:

## Description of the problem and the sequential solution algorithm:
>In this assignment, we discover the triangle number series utilizing SHARED MEMORY using OpenMP, Java ExecutorService, and DISTRIBUTED MEMORY using MPI. We are using Java and C++ language in four ways: sequential Java, two parallel by C++, and one with Java. The user must provide an n number that is more than zero in both sequential and parallel solutions, and the solution discovers triangular number series between 1 and the entered number. The triangular number formula is (n(n+1))/2.

### In this repo we define four soultion of Triangular number Series:
1- [Sequential In Java.](https://github.com/NorahFahad/Triangular_number_Series/blob/main/TriangularS.java)

2- [Parallel In Java. Share](https://github.com/NorahFahad/Triangular_number_Series/blob/main/Triangular.java)

3- [Parallel In C++ use OpenMP. Share](https://github.com/NorahFahad/Triangular_number_Series/blob/main/TiangularOpenMP.cpp)

4- [Parallel In C++ use MPI. Distrbited](https://github.com/NorahFahad/Triangular_number_Series/blob/main/triangularMPI.cpp)
